    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever thought that the bustling streets become sparsely populated? The bustling streets of New York City are sparsely populated by covid-19. Students will be taking classes online from home during 2020-2021 as many stores are closed under Covid-19. This is not the plot of a disaster movie, it is happening all over the world, do you want to know our life in the Covid-19 epidemic? This documentary project is about my life in New York from 2020 to 2022.

    	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the World Health Organization says that China's Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei province. A novel coronavirus was finally identified on December 31, 2019. The United States announced that students in all schools will have online classes at home until March 2020 due to Covid-19. At the time, Even though people knew Covid-19, most people thought Covid-19 was just happening in China. Before the college switched to online courses and companies switched to online offices, many students did not know covid-19, but some smart Chinese students started wearing masks on the street. Also, Donald Trump had been saying in the media that Covid-19 was fake news, and his supporters believe it, so not many people were wearing masks and walking down the street in New York. When the colleges were closed and told the student the school will change to online classes only, I didn't like to change to classes online because some courses we can't do at home. For example, ceramic design, music classes, etc.

    	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 2020, the New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday unveiled plans to reopen the city, saying 200,000 to 400,000 workers could return to work in the first half of June. New York City is expected to reopen in the first or second week of June. Industries to reopen in the first phase include construction and manufacturing, and non-essential retail (but curbside pickup only) such as apparel, electronics, furniture, office supplies, and sporting goods.

    	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all students have Wi-Fi or electronic devices, so many are uncomfortable with the school's move to online classes. A few days later, the network company launched a three-month free wifi package for students. I called immediately to inquire about the situation and made an appointment for installation. After 3 months, the free wifi becomes self-pay, so the extra income during the covid-19 has left many people unable to pay their rent, electricity, and internet bills.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Vaccination is mainly because of school requirements, but also worried about the side effects of vaccines when giving injections because there is really too much negative news about vaccines, but vaccines are the most effective method for us to fight against the covid-19 virus, so although the school does not require it. When there isn't so much negative news about vaccines, I'll go to get vaccinated.
